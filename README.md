# Analog_Clock

- **Languages used :** HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
- **Responsive :** Yes
- Basically,it's an analog clock which keeps itself updating after every 1 second just like a live clock.
- I have also added a toggle button,in which user can switch between **light** and **dark** theme.
- Realistic UI.
